# Frontend Environment Configuration

# Google Gemini API Key (for development mode only)
# In production, this should NOT be set. Use BACKEND_API_URL instead.
# Get your key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Backend API URL (for production mode)
# When set, the app will use the backend proxy instead of direct API calls
# Example: https://your-backend.run.app or https://api.yourdomain.com
# Leave empty for development mode with direct API calls
BACKEND_API_URL=

# Note: Never commit .env or .env.local files with real API keys!
